## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Things to Do:
# Rewrite fill_na (make run faster), take in vector for names. Using logical vectors to subset into data frame, Note, you can do df[is.na(df]] to look at all NAs. Also probably easier to load in select columns as a vector not a list (done)
# Find columns with just NAs and 1 other value - assumably 0 (done)
# Prepare to run fill_na on the necessary groups (should be 3 of them) - try using regular expressions (grep, etc) (done)
# Identify which columns you don’t want to use imputation on- think about each variable - they should fall under 2 options (or these are the 2 I’ve thought of (done)
# what are the general blocks (similar to question 3) (done)
# With the R file I attached, try to understand what some else wrote the function to do (I give some initial guidance in the code comments above the function (these were not provided by the person who wrote it)

#Get rid of these columns because they only have NA values.

#blocks hasve variables that are related to eachother that are not randomly assigned
#dont include things that are randomly assigned, like some implies that there will be nas everywhere else, buso don't include recruiter relationship unknown, type of labor unknnown, or other wones that are, 
#make means of control, type of exploit, recruiter relationship
#fill in 0s for a row with a 1 in the other group using shiva's fill na function
#use grep to find the names of the columns to identify the types of labor 




#leave out variables like "non-specified" because if it is 1 then the value is not stated...
#or the other way around, if the other values are not 
#maybe remove not specified because it is not valuable because either the values are zero or one and if we ipute then we get 0s anyways....
#for each block you can only use one type of imputation model.....
#you use the method for each group in the block....
#send ben the blocks and send him what you would like to use for the blocks
#the whole block has to have the same regression....'
