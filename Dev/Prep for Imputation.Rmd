```


There are three groups in which we can use the fill NA function.

Some of these columns should be taken out as there is no information inserted to them at all. this includes meansOfControl: TakesEarning, RestrictsFinaicialfAccess, Threats, PsychologicalAbuse, Physical Abuse ect.  

```{r}
imp_dataset <- big_merge_datasets[,-c((33:37),(41:48))]


```

```{r}
imp_dataset_names <- colnames(imp_dataset)
fill_control <- grep("meansOfControl+",imp_dataset_names, value=TRUE)

fill_control[-c(5),1]
```
